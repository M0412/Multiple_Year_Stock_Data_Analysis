           - The ticker symbol
           - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year 
           - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year 
           - The total stock volume of the stock.
    
      * Return the stock with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume
